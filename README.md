# How to Rickroll someone
## What is a rickroll? 
A rickroll is when you direct someone to a video or audio of Rick Astley's _Never Gonna Give You Up_ when they are not expecting it. This can be via links, QR codes, or even just playing it aloud. 
### How can I rickroll someone? 
There are multiple options, many of which have been widely used. You can: 
- use a URL shortening service to hide the URL 
- make a QR code to a rickroll 
- give someone a link that redirects to a rickroll. 
Of course, there are other options. But the best option is a timed redirect. 
### What is a timed redirect? 
A timed redirect is a redirect that happens after a specific amount of time. For example, many file sharing services use timed redirect so that users are forced to watch an ad, but cannot close the site or they will not be taken to the download. 
### How can a timed redirect be used to rickroll someone? 
A timed redirect can make the user think that the site is legitamatelya project or something. Then, the redirect will take place and they will get sent to the rickroll.
